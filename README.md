# iBox Generator

[![Angular 1](http://fountainjs.io/assets/imgs/angular1.png)](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide)

> This Yeoman generator allows you to start an iBox web app with the best Developer Experience out of the box!

> No matter what framework or module management you want to use, we got you covered with a cutting edge working configuration.

> We use [Gulp 4](http://gulpjs.com/) as a task manager but we'll ask you questions about:
- Modules management: Webpack, SystemJS, none
- JS preprocessor: Babel, TypeScript, none
- CSS preprocessor: Sass, Stylus, Less, none

This generator is a sub-generator of the the Yeoman Fountain generator for webapps [generator-fountain-webapp](https://github.com/FountainJS/generator-fountain-webapp).

## Generator iBox structure

To take profit of the best of the Yeoman infrastructure, we heavily relies on the composability natures of the generators.

Thereby, each needs of your future application will be addressed by a dedicated Yeoman generator (each will be used depending of the options you selected or not).
